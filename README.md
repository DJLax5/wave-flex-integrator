## Introduction

Wave-Flex Integrator simplifies your ham radio setup by directly connecting your **FlexRadio** to the **Wavelog** web-based logging software. It integrates DX Cluster data, enhances spot information, and synchronizes your frequency and mode, all without the need for traditional CAT software.

![SmartSDR Panadapter with Color-Coded Spots](assets/panadapter.png)

When a spot appears on your SmartSDR panadapter, not only does it display important information through color-coding and opacity, but hovering your mouse pointer over the spot will also reveal a popup with detailed information about the station, including DXCC status, worked-before status, and LoTW membership. This provides an immediate, clear overview of each spot without having to rely solely on visual cues.

Additionally, when you click on a spot, a pre-filled Wavelog logging window will automatically open in your browser, ready to log the QSO. This seamless integration allows you to focus more on operating and less on managing multiple applications.

> **Note:** The TNXQSO team is not affiliated with **Wavelog** or **FlexRadio**. This project is independently developed to integrate free of charge tools for the ham radio community. We exist only here on GitHub.

## Requirements

- **FlexRadio**: Compatible FlexRadio device (FLEX-6000-series) connected to your LAN or reachable over TCP/IP.
- **SmartSDR**: Installed and running on your local machine. Compatibility varies by version (see below).
- **Wavelog**: Installed and running (Version 1.8.6 or later).
- **DX Cluster Access**: A DX Cluster server accessible via Telnet. Find one [here](http://www.dxcluster.info/telnet/index.php).

### FlexRadio Compatibility

- **Supported Models**: All FlexRadio models that support TCP/IP communication.
- **Network Access**: The FlexRadio must be reachable from the machine running Wave-Flex Integrator.

### SmartSDR Versions and Compatibility

Wave-Flex Integrator communicates directly with the FlexRadio hardware, making it independent of the SmartSDR version used. However, some features depend on the capabilities of your SmartSDR software:

- **SmartSDR for Windows** (Developed by FlexRadio Systems):
  - [Download SmartSDR for Windows](https://www.flexradio.com/ssdr/)
  - **Click-to-Log Feature**: Fully supported. Clicking a spot opens a pre-filled Wavelog logging window.

- **SmartSDR for Mac** (Developed by Marcus & Jan Roskosch):
  - [SmartSDR for Mac](https://roskosch.de/smartsdr-for-mac/)
  - **Click-to-Log Feature**: **Not supported** due to software limitations. SmartSDR for Mac does not send information about clicked spots back to the FlexRadio, preventing Wave-Flex Integrator from triggering the logging action.

- **SmartSDR for iOS** (Also by Marcus & Jan Roskosch):
  - [SmartSDR for iOS](https://roskosch.de/smartsdr-features/)
  - **Click-to-Log Feature**: **Not tested**, but expected to have the same limitations as the Mac version.

- **FlexRadio M-Series** (Radios with integrated touchscreens):
  - **Click-to-Log Feature**: **Not tested**. Functionality may vary.

> **Important Note:** While the Wave-Flex Integrator is compatible with various versions of SmartSDR, the one-click logging feature is only available when using SmartSDR for Windows and probably also when using FlexRadio M-Series touch screen instead of SmartSDR.

## Usage

Start the application by launching it from the Start Menu (Windows), applications menu (Linux), or following the manual start procedure for macOS users.

Wave-Flex Integrator will connect to your DX Cluster and FlexRadio, enhance spots, and synchronize with Wavelog.

---

## How DXCC Confirmation is Determined

Wave-Flex Integrator seamlessly determines whether a DXCC entity is confirmed by querying your **Wavelog** installation. Wavelog, in turn, checks your configured QSL services to verify DXCC status. These settings can be found and adjusted in **Wavelog** under:

**Account** â†’ **Default Values** â†’ **Default QSL-Methods**

The QSL methods you have defined as default will dictate how DXCC confirmations are processed. For operators looking to apply for a **DXCC Award**, it's common to set **LoTW (Logbook of The World)** as the only QSL method, as LoTW is the official authority that grants DXCC awards. However, you can customize these methods based on your preferences and the types of confirmations you accept.
